# Distance

<!-- more -->

In a quiet corner, I confront turbulent thoughts. Feeling like a fleeting shadow, a whisper of what could be, burdened by the fear that my influence dim the glow of those around me. I'm scattered fragments, coalesced into a life distant and unreachable, like the dim light of a red dwarf gently present in the night sky, forever out of reach. I find myself adrift, caught between a dream of solace and the fear of becoming an anchor.
