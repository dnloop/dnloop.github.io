# Hello World!

Every beginning must be with a greeting to this world.

<!-- more -->

I've been postponing this project for a long time. I've tried different tools in the mean time but none suited my needs until I found [MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) a fascinating project for to organize documentation and collect my ideas into a blog. Its stack of tools includes Python as a backend, on the frontend it's Javascript, CSS, Typescript and HTML.

This page will contain links to my projects that are soon to be shared with the hope to be useful, as well as, other interests that'll emerge with time.

Thanks for reading.
